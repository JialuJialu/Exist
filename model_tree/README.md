# Building Model Trees

In CART (Classification and Regression Tree) algorithms, we build a tree by recursively splitting the training data via feature threshold cuts, such that the split data achieves the lowest overall weighted loss possible. By assigning a regression/classification model with a set loss function, we are appending a model to each node of the tree which motivates the concept of model trees which we provide the implementation for here.

To quickly visualize how a model tree could prove more useful than regular CARTs, consider the generated 1D training data below where we naively try to fit a linear regression model to it (this is exactly the `depth=0` model tree). The fit is poor as expected as the training data is generated from a 4th-order polynomial, but if you consider splitting the data into disjoint `x` segments as done by increasing the depth of the linear regression model tree, we can build a collection of linear regressors which accurately fit the individual segments well (`depth=1, 2, 3, 4, 5`), and thus giving us a well-trained model without needing too much explicit knowledge of the underlying complexity of the training data distribution!

To hit the nail on the head with this example, we can also directly compare results of fitting the 1D training data using a linear regression model tree fitting with *scikit learn*'s default decision tree regressor (which uses mean-value regression). In the plot below, we can immediately see how *scikit learn*'s decision tree regressor at `depth=5` is still is not a great model because it struggles to capture the `x` variability in the data, whereas the model tree is already able to capture much of the training distribution at depths lower than 5.

### Usage

Below are the model tree parameters to set before running the code:

* `model`: `mean_regr`, `linear_regr`, `logistic_regr`, `svm_regr`, `modal_clf` (you can create your own as well)
* `max_depth`: 1, 2, 3, 4, ...
* `min_samples_leaf`: 1, 2, 3, 4, ...
* `search_type`: "greedy", "grid", "adaptive"
* `n_search_grid`: number uniform grid search points (activated only if `search_type = grid` or `search_type = adaptive`) 
* `verbose`: True, False

When your parameters are set, run the command

> python3 run_model_tree.py

which:

1) Loads the data

2) Trains the model tree

3) Outputs: a tree-diagram schematic, trained model tree, model tree training predictions

4) Cross validates the model

The `stdout` text of the run should look like:

```

### Test usage

To ensure our model tree implementation is working, you can also run our test function

> python3 run_tests.py

which will:

1) Reproduce the original model result at model tree depth-zero

2) Reproduce sklearn's default Decision Tree Classifier implementation (`DecisionTreeClassifier`) using modal classification with Gini class impurity loss
 
3) Reproduce sklearn's default Decision Tree Regressor implementation(`DecisionTreeRegressor`) using mean regression with mean squared error loss

4) Generate plots of model tree predictions of a 4th-order polynomial at different tree depths using linear regression model trees (`output/test_linear_regr_fit.png`) and mean regression model trees (`output/test_mean_regr_fit.png`)
